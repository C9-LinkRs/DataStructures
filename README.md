# Basic data structure software

This software has implemented some data structure like BST trees and graph (directed and undirected), you can draw your BST tree (After level 5-6 the code draws bad). You can apply BFS algorithm to the BST tree, in the graphs you can apply BFS and Dijkstra algorithms, of course you will see all the path of these algorithms (only BFS for BST tree right now).
As well its implement some sorts like quickSort, selecSort, insertSort and shellSort and you can see all the interations.
